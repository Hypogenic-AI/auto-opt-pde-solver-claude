  title: Automatic Optimization of a PDE Solver
  domain: scientific_computing
  hypothesis: 'Automatic AI scientist methods can improve the performance and efficiency
    of a PDE optimizer, specifically by enhancing parallelization for adaptive grids,
    enabling kernel fusion, and optimizing interpolation from spectral to uniform
    grids.

    '
  background:
    description: 'The project aims to test whether automatic AI scientist approaches
      can improve a PDE optimizer implemented in JAX. Current limitations include
      lack of parallelization for adaptive grids during the merge step, separation
      of local solve and merge stages that may benefit from kernel fusion, and inefficient
      interpolation from spectral to uniform grids using dense matrix-vector products
      instead of fast Fourier transforms. The project references the jaxhps codebase
      and its associated paper, and suggests exploring tools like OpenEvolve and ShinkaEvolve.

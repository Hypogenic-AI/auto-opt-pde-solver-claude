Resource finding phase completed successfully.
Timestamp: 2026-01-06T10:58:00
Papers downloaded: 6
Datasets documented: 3 (jaxhps built-in, PDEBench, NIST AMR benchmarks)
Repositories cloned: 3 (jaxhps, PDEBench, HPS)

Summary:
- Primary codebase: jaxhps (JAX implementation of HPS solver)
- Key papers cover GPU optimization, adaptive grids, and autodiff integration
- Built-in test problems available in jaxhps for immediate experimentation
- PDEBench provides neural solver baselines for comparison

Ready for experiment runner phase.
